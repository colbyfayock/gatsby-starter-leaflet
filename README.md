# Getting Started

## Requirements

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Quick Start
Run the following in your favorite terminal:
```
gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet
```

## Starting from Scratch
* Set up Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)[https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
* Install the Gatsby CLI globally:
```
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```
* Inside the directory of your choice, scaffold a new Gatsby site:
```
gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet
```
For example, if I want my installation in `~/Code/new-gatsby-site`, I would navigate to `~/Code` and run:
```
gatsby new new-gatsby-site https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet
```
* Navigate to your new directory and run:
```
yarn develop
```
